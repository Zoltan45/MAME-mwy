Team Plus Games MAME FAQ

by RustyDawg37, ZPaul2Fresh8, TehDrewsus

https://discord.gg/hPtzkUX - MK+ Discord Server


The main reason I wrote this guide/FAQ is to help others use these games with their current or planned emulation
setup.  This FAQ includes information relating to Mortal Kombat + Alpha, Mortal Kombat II + Beta 2 and
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 + Beta 2, as well as information about past releases and testing builds
when available.  Please feel free to get in touch with me on the MK+ discord server regarding the content.

First a little introduction of the overarching ideas here.  The Team Plus games are arcade rom hacks of Mortal
Kombat 2 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.  Sometimes MAME can be fooled into playing a romhack by renaming the
romzip, using command line, or a batch file. This is the case with Mortal Kombat 2 +, but the only way to
play Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is to add it to the MAME program itself to create native support because it uses
more rom chips than the original hardware and MAME does not account for them. In general this can be done by
adding the game to its respective machine driver files and to the list of games included in MAME, and then
compiling the program.  The methods for implementation may vary by MAME version.  

Along the way you may find terms regarding MAME that you might not be familiar with.  You may need to
familiarize yourself with many aspects of MAME from building it all the way through modifying, but
most of those topics are outside the scope of this FAQ.  If you wish to learn more, you can start by
visiting https://www.mamedev.org.

Please read the whole FAQ before requesting assistance on the discord server.




1.  Windows users specifically, here is Paul's original FAQ from the site:

	A.  Which version of MAME is best for me?

	Mortal Kombat 2+ is compatible with any version of MAME between 0.119 and 0.203.

		The version you use will depend on your computer processor. The newer version of MAME that
		you use, the more accurate the game emulation is, thus requiring a faster computer processor
		to run the games at full speed. If you have a 64-bit processor then you want to use a 64-bit
		version of MAME (games can run up to 40% faster). It's best to use the newest version of MAME
		as long as your computer processor can handle it. We recommend that you use the version of
		MAME that is offered on the MortalKombatPlus.com Download page. This special version has been
		modified to recognize Mortal Kombat 2 Plus as it's own game. You may chose to use a different
		version of MAME, but you may get an error when trying to load MK2.zip. Don't worry! We will go
		over how to get around such problems in a later section.

	B. A special MK2+ version of MAME64 is available in the download section. To setup this version of
	MAME, you first have to download it. Once downloaded you are going to extract MAME64.zip. Inside
	our MAME64 folder we will find an EXE and a txt file.

	Next create a new folder and name it "roms".

	Our patched MK2+ rom file needs to be placed into this folder. Since this version of MAME will
	find MK2+ as it's own program, we will need to rename the rom file from "mk2.zip" to "mk2p.zip".

	Now that we have the rom in place, we can launch MAME64.exe, find "Mortal Kombat II Plus (Hack)"
	on the list, and run it. If you are running windows 10 you may receive a warning message. Simply
	click "more info" and then "run anyway".

	While inside of MAME you can customize your buttons and settings by pressing the "Tab" key. To
	change your button mappings you want to select "Input(this Machine)". To change MK2+ settings you
	can do that in the "Dip Switches" menu by turning on "Test Switch". Keep in mind that you need to
	turn "Test Switch" off again before it will allow you to get back into the game (the F2 button is
	a shortcut button to toggle the "Test Switch" on and off).

	C. With newer versions of MAME you will get this error ( incorrect checksum ) if you try to load MK2+

	To Launch MK2+ you need to do it from command line. One method is to go to command prompt, change
	directory to your MAME directory, and load MAME with this command

  This method can be annoying, so the best thing to do is create a batch file (like a shortcut) to
	load the game. To create a batch file simply load notepad and type in the following.

  Once done, you're going to click "File > Save as...", change the save as type to "All files", name
	the file "MK2Plus.bat", and save it in your MAME folder.

	You now have a shortcut to play Mk2+



2.  PC users in general.

There will be bugs in MAME.  MAME is a tool used in development, but the
target of the project is actual hardware.  If you experience bugs, you are encouraged to report them,
but if they are in MAME only, they may not be addressed if they cannot be reproduced on actual hardware.

Your options are to:

	A. Download the special MAME versions compiled to be able to play the games, available in 32 or 64
	bit versions, at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wdghx9Goyjc3hdM3fNMut_79wRnqL4CD.

	*Although a 32 bit version is available it is recommended to use the mame2003plus retroarch core in any 32 bit setup.

	B. There is a repository on github with the current version	of MAME with the Team Plus games included
	at https://github.com/Zoltan45/mame-mwy which you can compile using instructions from
	https://docs.mamedev.org/initialsetup/compilingmame.html?highlight=compile#all-platforms and
	https://www.mamedev.org/tools/.

	C. Another modified version of MAME called HBMAME which includes support for the Team Plus games as well as a LOT of
	other rom hacks can be found at:
	https://hbmame.1emulation.com/
	
	*This MAME fork is no longer updated past MAME 0.245 as its base, besides to add games.

	D. Use retroarch and download one of the emulation cores that are available that can play the game.
	Currently there are 5 cores available - mame2003, mame2003plus, mame2010 (UMK3+ only), hbmame, and FBNeo.
	If the game does not get added to your system playlist automatically, look for information on adding games manually to
	playlists at https://docs.libretro.com/guides/roms-playlists-thumbnails/.
	
	*At this time, I would not recommend using any MAME(year) cores besides 2003 and 2003plus, or FBNeo cores
	if you must use retroarch.
	
	E.  Lastly, the games will also work on FBNeo and Fightcade FBNeo.

	Please note that each emulator mentioned above requires your rom files to be named in different ways detailed
	below.  See documentation and source code for your chosen emulator to find out the correct naming of the rom
	files inside the romzip.  The names will change from time to time.

3. Single board computer users

If you are using a single board computer such as a raspberry pi, SNES Classic, etc.

Your options are to:

	A. Use retroarch or retropie and download the mame2003plus core.  There are other cores that may
	run on single board computers, but mame2003plus has been optimized and heavily modified over time to give
	many reasons to make it the only choice for these situations.

	How to get retropie and retroarch setup on these platforms is beyond the scope of this document.
	Please review documentation at the sites below if you need assistance with them.

	https://hakchi.net/ for hacking NES Classic/Mini, SNES Classic/Mini, Sega Classic Mini
	https://retropie.org.uk/
	https://www.retroarch.com/
	
	B. These litle machines have come a long way since the FAQ was first written.  I am keeping the above for
	now, but newer boards like a raspberry pi 4 or 5 can play standard MAME without issue on these games.
	Compiling and using current MAME is now a viable option for some single board computers.



4.  I want to do something else, what now?

	A. You will likely have to make additions to the source code of your favorite or chosen emulator, and
	compile it from source for your target platform.

	There are two ways to do this. You can cross compile your program, which is to compile it on a machine
	which is not the machine that you intend to run the program on, or native compile it on the intended
	use machine.  I would suggest native compile for newer users.

	Typically the files that need adjustments are the drivers for Midway T unit and Wolf unit machines as
	well as the list of games in the emulator.

	You will usually find the source code needed to make changes on Github.com.  If you are going to go
	this route, you really need to familiarize yourself with how to use and get around github.  My
	suggestion would be to fork the repository of the emulator you want to use.  That way even if the
	developers of said emulator are not interested in adding the Team Plus games to their emulator, you
	can still add it for your own personal use and have the ability to get outside assistance
	with your code.

	If you need examples of how plus games are added to an emulator, check out
	https://github.com/libretro/mame2003-plus-libretro/blob/master/src/drivers/midwunit.c



5. I have followed the instructions here/website/youtube and my rom does not work, what's wrong?

	The questions that come up most often have to do with patching or rom naming.  The base rom for
	the Mortal Kombat games has not changed much, if at all, over the last 25 or so years, so if you
	look at	your romzip and the romfile names do not match what is being shown/demonstrated/required, you
	can just change the file names or locate your rom from a different source and then attempt patching
	again. Either solution will	work.

	There are instructions and a tutorial video on how to patch the roms using lunar ips patcher,
	an original rom, and the patch files for your chosen Team Plus game located	at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Poao0eFYw&t=1s.
	Some of the file names in your rom zip may not be identical to what the video shows, but none of them are so different
	that you should not be able to figure out which romfile	should have each patch file applied to it.  The rom file names
	usually include something referring to what chip the file corresponds to.  The instructions	have been poured over
	many times and are spot on but the names of the individual rom files can and do change over time.

	If you have trouble getting your rom working and you believe it has been patched correctly, in most
	emulators, changing the name of the rom files to exactly what the emulator expects will make them work correctly.
	Each of the emulators mentioned above uses a different naming convention and format, so even though
	the rom is correct, in some instances an emulator will not start the game due to the conflict.


	If you are using MAME-mkp 0.119 32 bit, the romzip for Mortal
	Kombat 2 + should be named mk2p.zip, and the rom files inside should be named as below:

    These are the most common possible methods to achieve a setup with a working Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 +,
Mortal Kombat II +, and Mortal Kombat + game rom.  If you have something not addressed here, please try joining
the MK+ discord server and seek assistance in the mame-related channel.

6.  How do I play the Work In Progress or Kontributor builds?

	These directions assume that your current setup already works with a MK1 romzip, MK2 romzip, and a UMK3+ romzip.
	
	If you are using MAME, rename the new kontributor or work in progress romfiles to match the similarly named romfiles
	inside your working romzip, then replace the old files with the new files. IE, if the kontributor files includes a
	file with a name and/or extension including u2, rename it to match the u2 romfile filename inside your already working
	Team Plus romzip.  Make sure you zip everything back up!  You may have to use the command line or batch
	file to	execute the game after doing this depending on which MAME emulator above you are using.

	A typical batch file would include something like "start mame umk3p"

	If you are using FBNeo, name your Kontributor or work in progress builds romzip to match your original romzip.  Then
	place the Kontributor or work in progress romzip into your fbneo/patched folder.  Consult the FBNeo release documentation
	relating to your setup for the location of this folder in your build.
